# VSP Linear Inverse Problem  

This MATLAB code focuses on estimating vertical seismic slowness using travel time measurements of seismic waves. 

## Methods:  
 
- **SVD Method:** Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) estimates slowness distribution with simulated noisy data.  
- **Tikhonov Regularization:** Applied to enhance slowness estimation using the L-curve method for optimal regularization parameter (alpha).  

## Results:  

The estimated slowness from both SVD and Tikhonov methods is presented and compared to the original velocity model to assess accuracy.
